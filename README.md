### Introduction

##### Get the main window of an Electron Application.

Finding the main window of an electron app can be tricky, this npm package solves this issue. Follow further instructions to implement the same inside your app.

Initially, I'd created **electron-main-window** package for [OpenMTP  - Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp "OpenMTP  - Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS"). It works fine with [Electron React Redux Advanced Boilerplate](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/electron-react-redux-advanced-boilerplate "Electron React Redux advanced boilerplate") and [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate "electron-react-boilerplate")

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install electron-main-window

or 

$ yarn add electron-main-window
```

## Usage

```javascript
// Import ES6 way
import { getMainWindow } from 'electron-main-window';
const mainWindow = getMainWindow();

// Import ES2015 way
const mainWindow = require('electron-main-window').getMainWindow();

// e.g:
if(mainWindow !== null ){
	mainWindow.webContents.send('mainWindowCommunication', "This is a test message");
}
```
